            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p>
                PlanetX is a puzzle game with segregate levels that are usually pretty short and require a specific
                trick
            </p>
            <p>
                to be solved. They can be restarted instantly and an arbitrary amount of times. Dying will restart you
                current level, meaning once a level is completed it doesn't have to be played again.
                The degree of difficulty reaches from super easy tutorials that teach to the basic mechanics to tricky
                conundrums that require thorough understanding of how the game works and outside-the-box thinking.

            <h1> The Story </h1>
            <p>
                You are an <b class="highlight-text"> elite biologist </b> and <b class="highlight-text">master
                    gardener</b>
                sent
                out by the United
                Nations to help terraform
                distant
                planets and make them inhabitable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your specific task is to bring the oxygen production rate to at least a neutral level. Luckily all of
                the planets you are sent to have native Plants that provide oxygen on their own. The only thing you need
                to do to encourage the production is to water the plants that are already there.
                But watch yourself! Some of those plants will inevitably be hostile and might even move in order to try
                and catch you. Sometimes you might even have to cut down a plant or two in order to survive, even if it
                worsens the state of the planet and puts you further away from reaching your goal.
                In some locations you will even find ancient structures of long forgotten civilizations such as
                constructions providing artificial Gravity.

            <h1> Gameplay </h1>
            <p>
                Puzzle your way through 8 different Planets with unique enemies and obstacles. Each enemy will give you
                the
                choice of watering it or cutting it down. Both methods render it harmless. Cutting will completely wipe
                it
                out while watering it makes it remain on the map as an obstacle that provides oxygen permanently. Use
                these
                two mechanics to achieve both win conditions:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>A neutral or higher oxygen rate
                    You yourself consume oxygen while plants provide some. Plants you have watered will often produce
                    more
                    oxygen afterward. </li>
                <li>Reaching your rocket to escape from the planet
                    As soon as you have achieved a neutral oxygen rate your rocket will open up, letting you jump into
                    it in
                    order to escape the location and complete the level. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition to plants some levels will contains levers that introduce new mechanics.</p>
