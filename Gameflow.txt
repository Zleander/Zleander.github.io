PlanetX is a puzzle game with segregate levels that are usually pretty short and require a  specific trick to be solved. They can be restarted instantly and an arbitrary amount of times. Dying will restart you current level, meaning once a level is completed it doesn't have to be played again.
The degree of difficulty reaches from super easy tutorials that teach to the basic mechanics to tricky conundrums that require thorough understanding of how the game works and outside-the-box thinking.
